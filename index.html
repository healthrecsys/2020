	  <h1>Objectives</h1>
	  <p>
		  
		  
		  
Recommendations are becoming evermore important in health settings with the aim being to assist people live healthier lives. Three previous workshops on Health Recommender Systems (HRS) have incorporated diverse research fields and problems in which recommender systems can improve our awareness, understanding and behaviour regarding our own, and the general public's health. At the same time, these application areas bring new challenges into the recommender community. Recommendations that influence the health status of a patient need to be legally sound and, as such, today, they often involve a human in the loop to make sure the recommendations are appropriate. To make the recommender infallible, complex domain-specific user models need to be created, which creates privacy issues. While trust in a recommendation needs to be explicitly earned through, for example,  transparency, explanations and empowerment, other systems might want to persuade users into taking beneficial actions that would not be willingly chosen otherwise. Multiple and diverse stakeholders in health systems produce further challenges. Taking the patient's perspective, simple interaction and safety against harmful recommendations might be the prioritized concern. For clinicians and experts, on the other hand, what matters is precise and accurate content. Healthcare and insurance providers and clinics all have other priorities. This workshop will deepen the discussions started at the three prior workshops and will work towards further development of the research topics in Health Recommender Systems.

<p>Our aim is to enhance the results of the first two workshops in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Elaborate discussion topics of the previous workshops on health promotion, health care as well as methods
<li>Strengthen the community of researchers working on Health in RecSys
<li>Attract representatives from e.g. health, psychology, medicine, nutrition, fitness
<li>Find cross-domain collaboration projects and funding targets
<li>Exchange and share infrastructure (datasets and tools)
</ul>
</p>
<p>We invite submissions that may include the following topics, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Algorithms and Recommendation Strategies
<li>Domain Knowledge Representation
<li>Regulations and Standards
<li>Medical Evaluation Techniques
<li>User Profiling
<li>Pervasive Systems
<li>Personalization
<li>Behavioral Interventions
<li>Persuasion/Nudging/Behavioral Change
<li>Gamification and Serious Games
<li>Adherence
<li>Empowerment
<li>Trust
<li>Explanations
<li>Patient Needs/ Satisfaction
<li>User Interaction Design
<li>Human/ Expert-in-the-Loop
<li>Privacy
<li>Ethics
</ul></p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to share and discuss research and projects that reach beyond classic recommender techniques and discuss health domain related challenges of recommender systems.</p>

<a id="submission"></a> 
	  <h1>Submission</h1>
<p>We solicit short research papers (Up to 6 pages) and short position papers (2 pages), both in the ACM conference paper style. Participants can decide between a research focused submission and a project focused submission.
We especially encourage the submission of COVID-19-related works. To prioritize such contributions, related submissions to COVID-19 have no page limits. 
A selection of best papers will be presented in a flash talk. Further papers will be presented in the form of a poster. Papers should be submitted in TBA to the submission page.</p>
<p>Submission category research: innovative research ideas, preliminary results or system prototypes</p>
<p>Submission category project: funded research projects, industry and research collaborations or health-care and research collaborations</p>
<p>Submission guidelines: All submitted papers must
<ul>
<li>be written in English;
<li>contain author names, affiliations, and email addresses;
<li>be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM SIG Proceedings Template</a> with a font size no smaller than 9pt;
<li>be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any platform), and formatted for US Letter size;
</ul>
</p>
<p>Link or demo in attachment are preferred in both cases. All papers will be peer-reviewed, must not be under review in any other conference, workshop or journal (at the time of submission), and must contain novel contributions. Accepted papers will be published according to the ACM RECSYS 2019 WS publication rules.

<p><b>A few remarks:</b>
<ol>
<li>The title of the paper, authors, and the author order cannot be changed after the acceptance
<li>Major changes to the text of the reviewed and accepted papers are not permitted after the review
<li>At least one of the authors should participate in the workshop, register in the RecSys conference, and personally present the paper in the workshop.
